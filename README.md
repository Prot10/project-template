# Python Project Template

This repository contains a template for a Python project. It is intended to be used as a starting point for data science projects at DIAG. The template is based on the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project.

## TODO

- [ ] Change folder name `template` under `src` to `<project>`

</br>

- [ ] Change **1st line** (line 1) in `src/<project>/__init__.py`

</br>

- [ ] Change **project name** (line 6) in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Change **project description** (line 7) in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Change **tool.hatch.version path** (line 28) in `pyproject.toml`

</br>

- [ ] Change **DVC url** in `.dvc/config` to `ssh://lxplus.cern.ch/eos/project/d/diagbox/dvc/<project>` (and create the folder if it does not exist)
